# CMB Team
A little app I created to meet the Coffee Meets Bagel team!

### Requirements
   1. Xcode 8.2
   2. iOS 10
   3. Cocoapods

### Installation
   1. cd into the directory with `Podfile` in terminal
   2. run `pod install`
   3. open `CMBTeam.xcworkspace` in Xcode
   4. Run!

### Libraries
   1. AlamofireImage
      - Used for synchronous image loading.
   2. SwiftyJSON
      - Used to handle JSON a little more intuitively.
   3. LayoutKit
      - This is a neat little library I found by the LinkedIn team on Github. LayoutKit is a faster and more friendly alternative to AutoLayout. I usually like to try new frameworks out every so often, and thought this app would be a great chance to try LayoutKit!
